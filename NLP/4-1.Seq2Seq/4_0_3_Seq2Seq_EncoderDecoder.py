# # 2 - Learning Phrase Representations using RNN Encoder-Decoder for Statistical Machine Translation
# 
# In this second notebook on sequence-to-sequence models using PyTorch and TorchText, we'll be implementing the model
# from [Learning Phrase Representations using RNN Encoder-Decoder for Statistical Machine Translation](
# https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1078). This model will achieve improved test perplexity whilst only using a single layer
# RNN in both the encoder and the decoder.
# 
# ## Introduction
# 
# Let's remind ourselves of the general encoder-decoder model.
# 
# ![](assets/seq2seq1.png)
# 
# We use our encoder (green) over the embedded source sequence (yellow) to create a context vector (red). We then use
# that context vector with the decoder (blue) and a linear layer (purple) to generate the target sentence.
# 
# In the previous model, we used an multi-layered LSTM as the encoder and decoder.
# 
# ![](assets/seq2seq4.png)
# 
# One downside of the previous model is that the decoder is trying to cram lots of information into the hidden
# states. Whilst decoding, the hidden state will need to contain information about the whole of the source sequence,
# as well as all of the tokens have been decoded so far. By alleviating some of this information compression,
# we can create a better model!
# 
# We'll also be using a GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) instead of an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory). Why? Mainly because
# that's what they did in the paper (this paper also introduced GRUs) and also because we used LSTMs last time. To
# understand how GRUs (and LSTMs) differ from standard RNNS, check out [this](
# https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/) link. Is a GRU better than an LSTM? [Research](
# https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.3555) has shown they're pretty much the same, and both are better than standard RNNs.
# 
# ## Preparing Data
# 
# All of the Dataset preparation will be (almost) the same as last time, so we'll very briefly detail what each code
# block does. See the previous notebook for a recap.
# 
# We'll import PyTorch, TorchText, spaCy and a few standard modules.

# ![](assets/seq2seq7.png)
# 
# Again, in this implementation we need to ensure the hidden dimensions in both the encoder and the decoder are the
# same.
# 
# Briefly going over all of the steps: - the `outputs` tensor is created to hold all predictions, $\hat{Y}$ - the
# source sequence, $X$, is fed into the encoder to receive a `context` vector - the initial decoder hidden state is
# set to be the `context` vector, $s_0 = z = h_T$ - we use a batch of `<sos>` tokens as the first `input`,
# $y_1$ - we then decode within a loop: - inserting the input token $y_t$, previous hidden state, $s_{t-1}$,
# and the context vector, $z$, into the decoder - receiving a prediction, $\hat{y}_{t+1}$, and a new hidden state,
# $s_t$ - we then decide if we are going to teacher force or not, setting the next input as appropriate (either the
# ground truth next token in the target sequence or the highest predicted next token)
