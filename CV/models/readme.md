## Computer Vision

### Classify
 Image classification issue drew great attention as a prominent research topic. For tradi-tional image classification method,
 huge volume of image data was of difficulty to process and the requirements for the operation accuracy and speed of 
 image classification could not be met. However, deep learning-based image classifi-cation method broke through the 
 bottleneck and became the mainstream method to finish these classification tasks. The research  significance  and 
 current  development  status  of  image  classification  was  introduced  in  detail.
 
 ### GAN
 Generative Adversarial Networks, or GANs for short, are an approach to generative modeling using deep learning methods,
 such as convolutional neural networks.Generative modeling is an unsupervised learning task in machine learning that
 involves automatically discovering and learning the regularities or patterns in input data in such a way that the model
 can be used to generate or output new examples that plausibly could have been drawn from the original dataset.
 
 ### Open-set domain adaption
 
For many applications, training data is scarce due to thehigh cost of acquiring annotated training data. 
Althoughthere are large annotated image datasets publicly available,the images collected from the Internet often differ 
from thetype of images which are relevant for a specific applica-tion. Depending on the application, the type of sensor 
or theperspective of the sensor, the entire captured scene mightgreatly differ from pictures on the Internet. The two 
typesof images are therefore in two different domains, namely thesource and target domain. In order to classify the 
images inthe target domain using the annotated images in the sourcedomain, the source and target domains can be aligned.
