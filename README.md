This repository provides tutorial code for deep learning researchers to learn [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)

PyTorch is a Python-based scientific computing package serving two broad purposes:

- A replacement for NumPy to use the power of GPUs and other accelerators.
- An automatic differentiation library that is useful to implement neural networks.


PyTorch, like most other deep learning libraries, supports reverse-mode automatic differentiation of
scalar functions (or vector-Jacobian products of functions with multiple outputs), the most important form 
of automatic differentiation for deep learning applications which usually differentiatea single scalar loss.
You write code as if you were executing tensor operations directly; however, 
instead of operating on Tensors (PyTorch’s equivalentof Numpy’s nd-arrays), 
the user manipulates Variables, which store extra metadata necessary for AD. Variables support a backward() method, 
which computes the gradient of all input Variables involved in computation of this quantity.
