This repository provides tutorial code for deep learning researchers to learn [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)

PyTorch is a Python-based scientific computing package serving two broad purposes:

- A replacement for NumPy to use the power of GPUs and other accelerators.
- An automatic differentiation library that is useful to implement neural networks.


PyTorch, like most other deep learning libraries, supports reverse-mode automatic differentiation of
scalar functions (or vector-Jacobian products of functions with multiple outputs), the most important form 
of automatic differentiation for deep learning applications which usually differentiatea single scalar loss.
You write code as if you were executing tensor operations directly; however, 
instead of operating on Tensors (PyTorchâ€™s equivalentof Numpyâ€™s nd-arrays), 
the user manipulates Variables, which store extra metadata necessary for AD. Variables support a backward() method, 
which computes the gradient of all input Variables involved in computation of this quantity.


This repository contains:

1. [Computer Vision(CV)](cv.md) Implement complex computer vision algorithms.
2. [Natural language processing(NLP)](nlp.md) Examples to show how NLP can tacke real problem.Including the source code,
dataset, state-of-the art in NLP.
3. [Dataset](data.md) All the data you can use in this project are under this directory.
4. [Reference](ref.md) Other reference materials for this project.

## Background

Standard Readme started with the issue originally posed by [@maxogden](https://github.com/maxogden) over at [feross/standard](https://github.com/feross/standard) in [this issue](https://github.com/feross/standard/issues/141), about whether or not a tool to standardize readmes would be useful. A lot of that discussion ended up in [zcei's standard-readme](https://github.com/zcei/standard-readme/issues/1) repository. While working on maintaining the [IPFS](https://github.com/ipfs) repositories, I needed a way to standardize Readmes across that organization. This specification started as a result of that.

> Your documentation is complete when someone can use your module without ever
having to look at its code. This is very important. This makes it possible for
you to separate your module's documented interface from its internal
implementation (guts). This is good because it means that you are free to
change the module's internals as long as the interface remains the same.

> Remember: the documentation, not the code, defines what a module does.

~ [Ken Williams, Perl Hackers](http://mathforum.org/ken/perl_modules.html#document)

Writing READMEs is way too hard, and keeping them maintained is difficult. By offloading this process - making writing easier, making editing easier, making it clear whether or not an edit is up to spec or not - you can spend less time worrying about whether or not your initial documentation is good, and spend more time writing and using code.

By having a standard, users can spend less time searching for the information they want. They can also build tools to gather search terms from descriptions, to automatically run example code, to check licensing, and so on.

The goals for this repository are:

1. A well defined **specification**. This can be found in the [Spec document](spec.md). It is a constant work in progress; please open issues to discuss changes.
2. **An example README**. This Readme is fully standard-readme compliant, and there are more examples in the `example-readmes` folder.
3. A **linter** that can be used to look at errors in a given Readme. Please refer to the [tracking issue](https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme/issues/5).
4. A **generator** that can be used to quickly scaffold out new READMEs. See [generator-standard-readme](https://github.com/RichardLitt/generator-standard-readme).
5. A **compliant badge** for users. See [the badge](#badge).

## Install

This project uses [node](http://nodejs.org) and [npm](https://npmjs.com). Go check them out if you don't have them locally installed.

```sh
$ npm install --global standard-readme-spec
```

## Usage

This is only a documentation package. You can print out [spec.md](spec.md) to your console:

```sh
$ standard-readme-spec
# Prints out the standard-readme spec
```

### Generator

To use the generator, look at [generator-standard-readme](https://github.com/RichardLitt/generator-standard-readme). There is a global executable to run the generator in that package, aliased as `standard-readme`.

## Badge

If your README is compliant with Standard-Readme and you're on GitHub, it would be great if you could add the badge. This allows people to link back to this Spec, and helps adoption of the README. The badge is **not required**.
